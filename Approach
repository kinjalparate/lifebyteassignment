DevOps
Challenge V2



Question : How would you
further automate the management of the infrastructure if given unlimited time
and resources?

I would have followed the following steps for automating the
deployment of secure, publicly available HA Load-Balanced Web Servers that are
available in different AWS availability zones and will automatically rebalance
themselves if there is no healthy web server instance in either availability
zone and redirecting any HTTP requests to HTTPS. 


 Launching Amazon EC2
     Instances : We deploy Amazon EC2 instances. Specifying IP . Defining Security
     group since they exist in the same VPC for this case. We specify different availability zones for the
     same region. 


 Creating Elastic Load
     Balancer
     : We need properties of health
     checkers and redirecting HTTP
     requests to HTTPS.

 
  Health checker : This
      can be implemented by choosing the
      option given for it while deploying ELB.


  Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:
      Create listeners that acknowledge the HTTP requests.Under Rules section we select Redirect to action and mention
      HTTPS with its port. We need to ensure
      the security group allows traffic on HTTPS port .


 Deploying Autoscaling  : We create a template for autoscaling so
     as to distribute the traffic. In the Network
     section we choose the VPC
     we formed and deployed Amazon
     EC2 instances in different
     availability zones for same region. We then attach the ELB with all the specifications that we formed
     earlier.
     

I have done  code on
Terraform using AWS CLI and had deployed 3 Amazon EC2 instances on 3 subnets
for different availability zones in the same region.
